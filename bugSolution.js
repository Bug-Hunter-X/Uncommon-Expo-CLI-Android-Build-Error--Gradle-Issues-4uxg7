The solution often requires a multi-pronged approach. First, carefully check the contents of the `android/` folder. Look for any unusual Gradle configuration files or missing dependencies.  Next, ensure you have the correct versions of the Android SDK and NDK installed and properly configured.  Use Android Studio to inspect your Android project to check for errors and warnings. Then, try cleaning the project with `expo prebuild` or `./gradlew clean`. If dependency issues persist, review the `build.gradle` files within the `android` directory. Manually check for any version conflicts or missing dependencies. For very stubborn errors, consider creating a new Expo project and migrating your code to ensure your issue is not rooted in a corrupted project setup. In some rare cases, reinstalling the Android SDK and NDK might be necessary.

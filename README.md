# Uncommon Expo CLI Android Build Error: Gradle Issues

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered during the Android build process using Expo CLI. The error stems from issues within the Gradle build system, leading to varied error messages, often related to missing dependencies, misconfigurations, or problems with the Android SDK or NDK.

**Error Manifestation:**  The error manifests during the `expo build:android` command, producing errors that point to Gradle, its dependencies, or Android build tools. Specific error messages vary significantly, hence the challenge in identifying a singular root cause.

**Solution:** The proposed solution involves carefully reviewing the project's `android/` directory, ensuring proper Gradle configurations, and verifying the installation and configuration of the required Android SDK and NDK components.
